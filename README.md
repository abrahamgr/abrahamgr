Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Abraham Galindo
Iâ€™m interested in web development specially React and all the phases the application passes to be ready in production.
I worked for several years before as SharePoint Developer among other Microsoft Technologies, then I started to learn React for SPFX and I got interested. Later I decided to move as full Web Developer with React and Node JS.
I have leadership experience playing role of team lead and tech lead in small teams participating on conjunction with other teams. I am passionate about new technologies and challenges, I always 
enjoy sharing knowlege and I like to help people to achieve their goals.
